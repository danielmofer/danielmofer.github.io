## The author

I am Daniel Morales (danielmofer).

My passion for IT started when I was a kid and my father (a big fan of computing) motivated me to get close to computers to talk to them. When I was nine years old I got very exited when the [Command Line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) popped up on my screen during my first session of Windows, and I got even more excited when my father ran a script to make it rain letters on the CLI (he was like Morpheus showing me the Matrix)â€¦ and I still get exited every time the [reverse shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_connection) pops up, or the [C2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control) receives the first connection from the intrusion exercise. I would describe myself as a [Penetration Tester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test) with quite some experience, and I feel lucky saying that I do not work; companies pay me to do what I love.
