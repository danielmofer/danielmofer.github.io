## The author

<img src="/assets/images/danielmofer.jpg">

I am Daniel Morales (danielmofer).

My passion for IT started when I was a kid and my father (a big fan of computing) motivated me to get close to computers to talk to them. When I was nine years old I got very exited when the [Command Line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) popped up on my screen during my first session of Windows, and I got even more excited when my father ran a script to make it rain letters on the CLI (he was like Morpheus showing me the Matrix)… and I still get exited every time the [reverse shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_connection) pops up, or the [C2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control) receives the first connection from the intrusion exercise. I would describe myself as a [Penetration Tester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test) with quite some experience, and I feel lucky saying that I do not work; companies pay me to do what I love.

I’m writing this blog in order to fullfil my wish to share my knowledge (I also need some notes that are easy to get whenever I need them and what better way than having and online [cheat sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet)), so I hope the content of this blog will help you to obtain a quick win, to clap your hands or bring them to the air when you get the flag in a CTF or hit the target during a pentest.

If you are reading this looking for some personal information or [OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) task, here you are… I’m Venezuelan and a Spanish citizen, I speak Spanish (native), English (C1) und ein bisschen Deutsch (A2). I’m based in Europe.

## About Rotes Team


[Rotes Team](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Team) means [Red Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team) in German and it is the precise name which I was looking for for the blog, according with the content that I will post in here. [RotesTeam.com](http://rotesteam.com) is not the blog of a group of people, there is just one author (danielmofer).

Here, I will post writeups, technical research, tools, [PoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept), some stories of my experience and any information related to IT Security (offensive). I hope you like it, and remember that I’m always open to suggestions and criticism.

I also would like to thanks to [Patrick Marsceill](https://www.thismodernweb.com) for this amazing Jekyll template (JTD).
