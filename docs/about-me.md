# About Rotes Team
{: .no_toc }

---

I am Daniel Morales (danielmofer), and I do IT Security.

My passion for IT started when I was a kid and my father, a big fan of IT, motivated me to get close to computers to talk to them.
When I was nine years old I got very exited when Command Prompt pops up on my screen during my first session of Windows XP... and I still get exited every time when the reverse shell pops up or the C2 receive the first connection. I can describe to myself as a Penetration Tester with some experience, and I feel when I recognize that I do not work; companies pay me to do what I love.

If you are reading this looking for some personal information or OSINT task, here you are. I'm venezuelan und Spanish citizen, I speak spanish (native), enlgish (C1) und ein bisschen Deutsch (A1). I'm based in Europe.

# What about Rotes Team

I'm writing this blog in order to fulfil my wish to share my knowledge and receive some (I also need some notes easy to get whenever I need them and what better than having and online cheat sheet) so, "Rotes Team" means Red Team in german and it is the precise name that I was looking for the blog according to the content that I will post in here.

Here I will post writeups, research (I+D), tools, and whatever information related to IT Security (Offensive). I hope you like it, and remember that I'm always open to suggestions and criticism.
